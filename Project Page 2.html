            <h2>Muay Thai</h2>
            <p>One of my hobbies is martial arts, and I study Muay Thai. Known as Thailand's "art of eight limbs," Muay Thai is a stand-up fighting style that utilizes fists, elbows, knees, and shins to deliver strikes. Its specialty includes clinch fighting with knees and elbows, making it both brutal and beautiful. Intense training turns bodies into weapons, making Muay Thai a powerful form of self-defense and a popular competitive sport.</p>

        <section id="brazilian-jiu-jitsu">
            <h2>Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ)</h2>
            <p>Another martial art I practice is Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ). It's a grappling martial art focused on ground fighting, emphasizing technique and leverage to control a larger or stronger opponent. BJJ practitioners use throws, takedowns, and joint locks to gain dominant positions and force submissions, such as chokeholds or arm bars. BJJ promotes a "smaller person vs. larger person" mentality, making it popular for self-defense. Intense rolling practice sessions build fitness, technique, and mental fortitude. BJJ boasts a welcoming community and is known for its core values of respect and sportsmanship.</p>

        <section id="wrestling">
            <h2>Wrestling</h2>
            <p>Recently, I've picked up wrestling as another hobby. Wrestling is a thrilling mix of athleticism and theatricality, where two competitors grapple on a mat using throws, takedowns, and holds to pin their opponent's shoulders for a certain time. Beyond technical skills, wrestling is known for its high-flying maneuvers and dramatic pins. Wrestlers wear colorful singlets and often cultivate larger-than-life personas, adding to the spectacle. While demanding, wrestling fosters discipline, respect, and a strong work ethic, entertaining audiences with its blend of athleticism and showmanship.</p>
