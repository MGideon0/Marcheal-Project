            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>My name is Marcheal Gideon, and this is my website that is about me and the things I do.</p>
            <p>I was born in March of 1994 in Oakland, California, but I was raised in North Carolina. In 2022, I moved to Virginia after accepting a job offer with Amazon. However, I later accepted a role with Microsoft.</p>
            <p>I spent 8 years in the United States Army Reserve, where I served in a logistics position. I didn't really enjoy the work because logistics isn't for me.</p>

        <section id="work-hobbies">
            <h2>Work and Hobbies</h2>
            <p>I do, however, enjoy my job at Microsoft, working in a data center.</p>
            <p>My hobbies consist of video games and learning martial arts. I enjoy video games a lot and could play them all day. My favorite games are open-world games such as Skyrim, Elden Ring, and The Witcher 3. My least favorite games are horror games; I guess it's because there's something about them that's different.</p>
            <p>I also enjoy watching anime such as DragonBall Z, One Piece, and Black Clover. I've always been an anime fan since I was a kid, growing up mostly watching DragonBall Z, Yu-Gi-Oh, and One Piece.</p>

        <section id="education-goals">
            <h2>Education and Career Goals</h2>
            <p>I am hoping to finish my degree soon so I can have my associates. It's been a long journey, and I am still going strong.</p>
            <p>I am currently working towards certifications in cybersecurity, including Security+ and A+. Once I finish those, I will start looking for cybersecurity jobs.</p>
