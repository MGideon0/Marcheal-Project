            <h2>Experience in the Military</h2>
            <p>I spent 8 years in the United States Army Reserve, serving as a Logistical Military Specialist. In this role, I managed various logistical operations to support military activities. While I didn't particularly enjoy the career path I chose, I appreciated the opportunity to serve in the military.</p>
            <p>Upon leaving the military in January of 2022 with 70 percent disability, I reflected on my experience and decided to leverage my skills and knowledge in other areas, particularly in working for the federal government.</p>

            <h2>Automated Logistical Specialist</h2>
            <p>An Automated Logistical Specialist is the tech-savvy backbone of a warehouse operation. They juggle the physical world of inventory with the digital realm of data management. Imagine them as warehouse detectives, using automation and record-keeping skills to ensure smooth operations.</p>
            <p>Their day-to-day responsibilities include overseeing deliveries, verifying incoming supplies against digital records, managing placement within the warehouse, and maintaining accurate stock and equipment inventories in digital systems. They also collaborate with warehouse staff to unload, unpack, and store incoming goods while ensuring a safe and organized work environment.</p>
            <p>Think of them as the glue that holds a warehouse together, using automation and data to keep track of inventory, optimize space, and ensure everything runs efficiently.</p>
