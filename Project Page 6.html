            <h2>Ultimate Career Aspiration</h2>

            <p>In my studies, I've discovered fascinating facts about exoplanets, including the discovery of over 5,000 planets and the existence of systems similar to our own solar system. I'm particularly intrigued by the discovery of planets with oceans like ours.</p>
